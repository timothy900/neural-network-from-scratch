Updates on my neural network
Started on May 16

To do:
	Backpropagation
	Stochastic GD
	Import MNIST Data(Handwritten digits)
	Feedforward MNIST Data
	Train on MNIST Data
	Correctly classify MNIST samples

To do(visualize2.py):
	Clean the code: add variables, make it more readable, etc...
	Display the weights and biases of the neurons


Logs:

May 18
- number of layers and neurons in the network are adjustable
- can now feedforward through the network

May 19
- implemented drawNetwork function in visualize2.py, code still needs cleaning

May 23
- tried adding backpropagation. guess what happened next.

June 21
- It's been almost a month since I got stuck, and sentdex hasn't posted another video on the series yet. I'll just leave this project for now and I might come back to it when I can implement backpropagation.
