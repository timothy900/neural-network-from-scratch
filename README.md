# neural-network-from-scratch
i started this about 5 months ago. I was following sentdex's "Neural Network from Scratch" series. Then he stopped making the videos before making one on training the network. Then I wasn't able to finish it because I got stuck on implementing backpropagation on my own. Now I know some multivariable calculus, and maybe I can finish it.
