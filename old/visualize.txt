Purpose: 
- to visualize the neural network generated by neuralnet.py


Implement a function that draws the neural network,
which takes in the neuralNetwork object as input:

drawNetwork(neuralNetwork)

Operation:
- take the number of layers of the network
- take the number of neurons in each layer
- draw layers and neurons
- keep their positions
- draw lines between neurons

	or

- inputs: 
	- neuralNetwork object
	- radius of neurons
	- distance between neurons
	- distance between layers
	- (?) weight line thickness
- identify the x and y position of each layer based on number of layers and their lengths
- for each layer
	- for each neuron
		- draw neuron
